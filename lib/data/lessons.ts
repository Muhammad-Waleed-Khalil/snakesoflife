# 10 Ways Snakes Destroy Your Peace

## 1. They Make You Question Your Reality
Gaslighting snakes will have you doubting your own memory, your perception, your sanity. They rewrite history mid-conversation and act like you're the crazy one for remembering differently.

**Fix:** Write it down. Keep receipts. Your memory isn't broken—their manipulation is just that good.

## 2. They Steal Your Energy
Every interaction leaves you drained. They trauma-dump without consent, complain endlessly, and suck the oxygen out of every room they enter.

**Fix:** Set time limits. You don't owe anyone unlimited access to your emotional bandwidth.

## 3. They Weaponize Your Vulnerabilities
You trusted them with your insecurities, and now they use them as ammunition. Your fears become their leverage.

**Fix:** Stop sharing your deepest wounds with people who haven't earned that level of trust.

## 4. They Make Everything a Competition
Your win is their loss. They can't celebrate you without making it about themselves or one-upping you.

**Fix:** Find people who genuinely root for you. Real friends don't keep score.

## 5. They Thrive on Drama
If there's no crisis, they'll create one. They need chaos to feel alive, and you're collateral damage.

**Fix:** Refuse to engage. Gray rock method: be boring, unresponsive, unavailable.

## 6. They Never Apologize (Sincerely)
"I'm sorry you feel that way" is not an apology. It's a dismissal wrapped in fake remorse.

**Fix:** Demand real accountability or walk away. You deserve better than performative apologies.

## 7. They Play the Victim
No matter what they did, they'll twist the narrative until you're the villain and they're the wounded party.

**Fix:** Don't defend yourself to people who are determined to misunderstand you. Let them think what they want.

## 8. They Isolate You
Slowly, subtly, they'll drive wedges between you and other people. They need you dependent and alone.

**Fix:** Maintain your other relationships. If someone wants you all to themselves, run.

## 9. They Punish You for Boundaries
Set a boundary, and they'll sulk, guilt-trip, or rage. Your "no" is treated like a personal attack.

**Fix:** Hold the line. People who respect you will respect your boundaries. Everyone else can exit.

## 10. They Never Change
They promise to do better. They swear it'll be different this time. It won't. Snakes don't shed their venom—only their skin.

**Fix:** Believe patterns, not promises. If they've shown you who they are 10 times, stop waiting for version 11.

**The Brutal Truth:** You can't fix snakes. You can only remove them from your garden.

# How to Spot a Fake Ex Before They Strike

## The "I've Changed" Special
If they come crawling back with "I've changed," ask yourself: Did they go to therapy? Did they do the work? Or did they just miss having someone to use?

Real change takes time, effort, and proof. Words are free. Watch for actions.

## Love-Bombing 2.0
Excessive attention, grand gestures, immediate intimacy—it's not romance, it's a trap. They're trying to re-hook you before you remember why you left.

## The Selective Memory
They remember the good times in HD but have amnesia about the lying, cheating, or emotional abuse. Convenient.

## The Midnight "I Miss You" Text
They only reach out when they're lonely, bored, or their new supply fell through. You're not their first choice—you're their safety net.

**What to Do:** Block. Delete. Do not engage. You are not a backup plan.

## The "Just Friends" Lie
"Can't we just be friends?" Translation: "Can I keep you as an option while I explore others?"

If the friendship feels like breadcrumbs, it's because it is.

## The Guilt Trip
"You gave up on us." "You never gave me a real chance." "I thought you were different."

They're rewriting history to make you feel like the villain. Don't fall for it.

**The Truth:** You left for a reason. Trust that version of you. They knew what they were doing.

---

**Bottom Line:** A real apology comes with changed behavior. Anything else is just manipulation with better lighting.

# Why You Keep Feeding Snakes (And How to Stop)

## You Confuse Potential with Reality
You see who they could be, not who they are. You're in love with a fantasy, and they're happy to let you stay delusional.

**Fix:** Fall in love with reality. If someone shows you they're not ready, believe them.

## You Think Love Can Fix Them
Spoiler: It can't. You're not a rehab center. You're not their therapist. Your love will not heal their brokenness.

**Fix:** Stop auditioning for the role of savior. Let them save themselves.

## You're Afraid of Being Alone
So you tolerate disrespect, lies, and half-love because the alternative—being single—feels scarier.

**Fix:** Learn to be alone without being lonely. Your own company should be peaceful, not a punishment.

## You Don't Think You Deserve Better
Low self-worth is a magnet for snakes. They can smell it. And they'll exploit it.

**Fix:** Work on your self-esteem. When you know your value, you stop accepting scraps.

## You Mistake Intensity for Connection
Drama ≠ Passion. Chaos ≠ Chemistry. If the relationship feels like a roller coaster, you're not in love—you're addicted to adrenaline.

**Fix:** Seek calm, consistent love. Real connection doesn't require constant crisis.

## You Ignore Red Flags
"Maybe I'm overreacting." "It's not that bad." "Everyone has flaws."

No. You're not overreacting. It IS that bad. And flaws are different from abuse.

**Fix:** Trust your instincts. If something feels off, it is.

## You Give Too Many Chances
First strike: mistake. Second strike: pattern. Third strike: you're choosing this.

**Fix:** Stop giving people unlimited retries. Some people don't deserve a second chance.

---

**The Hard Truth:** You attract what you tolerate. Raise your standards, and the snakes will slither away on their own.
