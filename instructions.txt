You are an expert full-stack web engineer.
Build a production-ready, Vercel-deployable, dark, brutal satire web application called “Snakes of Life”.

The app exposes fictional archetypes of fake people (no real individuals), lets users vent, confess, chat, and consult a dark oracle, all anonymously, with end-to-end-style encryption and strong UX.

You MUST follow all instructions below.

🟣 0. PLATFORM & TECH REQUIREMENTS
Target platform

The app must be fully ready for deployment on Vercel with:

Correct project structure

package.json

Build scripts

Environment variable usage

SEO-optimized routing

Tech stack (you CAN use modern tools):

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS (or a similar utility-first CSS framework) + custom CSS for brutal visuals

UI/UX:

Prefer Headless UI, Radix UI, or similar for accessible components

Use Framer Motion or CSS animations for brutal effects

State management: lightweight (Zustand, Context API, or just React hooks)

Forms & validation: Zod or similar for schema validation

Database & storage:

Firebase:

Firestore for data storage

Firebase Storage for file uploads (images)

APIs:

Use Next.js Route Handlers or API routes for backend logic if needed (e.g., generating signed upload URLs, server-side helpers).

Security & Encryption:

Implement client-side AES-256 encryption for all user content before sending to Firebase.

Encryption key is generated per user and stored in browser storage (e.g., localStorage or IndexedDB).

Deployment:

App should deploy cleanly to Vercel with npm run build / npm run start.

🔒 1. PRIVACY, ANONYMITY & ENCRYPTION
No login:

No authentication:

No email/password

No OAuth

Each user gets a random anonymous ID generated client-side, persisted in localStorage.

Used for likes, comments, saves, chat nicknames.

Client-side encryption:

All user-generated content MUST be encrypted before being sent to Firebase:

Stories

Confessions

Frustration posts

Chat messages

Comments

Any personal metadata

Use AES-256-GCM or similar robust symmetric encryption.

Encryption key:

Generated locally per user

Stored only on the client (e.g., in localStorage)

Never stored in plaintext on Firebase or Vercel.

Firebase only stores:

ciphertext

non-sensitive metadata (timestamps, counters, derived IDs, etc.)

Provide a dedicated encryption.ts module with:

generateKey()

encrypt(text: string): Promise<string>

decrypt(ciphertext: string): Promise<string>

🐍 2. THEME & AESTHETIC
Visual style:

Dark, brutal, gritty design:

Backgrounds: pure black or near-black

Primary highlight: blood-red

Accent: toxic neon green (for snake motifs)

Use:

Horror/creepy display font (e.g., Creepster or similar via Google Fonts) for headings.

Sans-serif readable font (e.g., Roboto, Inter, or similar) for body text.

Imagery:

Snakes, venom, cracks, broken hearts, chains

Use free placeholder images/illustrations (no copyrighted/paid content)

All images must include alt text for accessibility and SEO.

Tone:

Raw, aggressive, darkly humorous

Profanity allowed for text like “F*** the fakes” (you can obfuscate vowels if needed)

No:

Real-world harassment

Targeted hate

Explicit real violence calls

Only fictional archetypes and satirical commentary.

Animations:

Snake “slither” hover animations

Cards that “crack” on click

Venom-drip transitions

Glitch effects for headings and special modes

Smooth but intense microinteractions (e.g., Framer Motion, CSS transitions)

🧭 3. APP STRUCTURE & PAGES (Next.js App Router)

Use the App Router (app/ directory) with file-based routing. At minimum, include these routes:

/ — Home / Den of Snakes

/hall-of-snakes — Hall of archetype profiles

/abyss — Confession mode

/oracle — Dark AI Oracle (mocked or pluggable)

/snake-pit — Anonymous chatroom

package.json

next.config.mjs or next.config.js

tsconfig.json

tailwind.config.js + postcss.config.js

app/layout.tsx & global layout

app/page.tsx and other route files

Components in components/:

Layouts, cards, buttons, modals, etc.

public/ assets as needed (icons, default images)

app/api/* routes if required

Also include:

Basic README with instructions:

Setup

.env variables (Firebase config, etc.)

npm run dev

Vercel deployment notes

🚀 20. DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (VERCEL)

The final project must:

Build successfully with npm run build

Be compatible with Vercel’s Next.js environment.

Ensure:

No hard-coded localhost-only URLs in production config

Firebase initialized with environment variables (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY, etc.)

Public keys are safe to expose as per Firebase norms, but encryption keys remain client-held.

✅ 21. GENERAL RULES

All written content must be original.

No mention of real individuals.

No illegal content, hate speech, or dangerous instructions.

Brutal humor and swearing allowed as style, but stay within fictional, satirical context.

All user content encrypted before leaving client.

UX should feel premium, cohesive, and intense.

🎯 FINAL TASK

Generate the complete Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind codebase according to this prompt, with all major routes, components, hooks, libraries, and configs needed to run the project locally and deploy it on Vercel.
